Hi D community!

I'm here again, to describe what I've done during the eleventh week of Symmetry
Autumn of Code.

## LLVM upstream follow up update

Three more patches in the D demangling patch train got merged!

- https://reviews.llvm.org/D111415
- https://reviews.llvm.org/D114305
- https://reviews.llvm.org/D114307

I joined this week on the LLVM official team to help provide maintenance on the
code I introduced and planning to introduce as well as general changes made for
D in the official tree.

I have 2 more patches already accepted about the demangling but I didn't merge
them yet, as I'm having some problems on running the test suite locally.

Currently, LLVM already supports special D main, simple multiple identifiers
and anonymous symbols. Next step is to support basic and compound types,
although I think this needs to be split up, as discussed in some patches.

## Implementation of basic types and decoupling Clang-specific code

I started this week implementing basic types on the D TypeSystem, although, in
the meanwhile, I found that some decoupling is needed, since the current LLDB
architecture for parsing debug info has some entanglement with clang-specific
structures such as the AST Context and other TypeSystem and AST related
structures. I though this was something already considered, but a lot of effort
on this was left behind when other languages stop being supported, like Go.

I made some patches to move that forward in the upstream:

- https://reviews.llvm.org/D114668
- https://reviews.llvm.org/D114719
- https://reviews.llvm.org/D114746

Still about the decoupling, I found out that only DWARF Parser is reasonably
decoupled, but other debug info parsers like
[PDB](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/lldb/source/Plugins/SymbolFile/PDB/PDBASTParser.cpp)
are really entangled with the Clang TypeSystem. There is no generic interface
at the moment, and I plan to decouple that as well, although, it is not really
a priority for me, since my main development environment is Linux. That said,
I'm probably going to left Windows support as a second priority, for now.

I added those patches to the [PR](https://github.com/ljmf00/lldb-d/pull/1) I
created last week and continued working on it.

## What is next?

I haven't finished the type wrapper to represent a D type, due to those
decoupling issues. I will hopefully finish the implementation next week and try
to have some simple output on the LLDB side.

Read about the [previous week](../d-saoc-2021-10/).
