## The challenge

### Part 1

> You come across a field of hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor! These vents
> constantly produce large, opaque clouds, so it would be best to avoid them if
> possible.
>
> They tend to form in lines; the submarine helpfully produces a list of nearby
> lines of vents (your puzzle input) for you to review.
>
> [...]
>
> Each line of vents is given as a line segment in the format x1,y1 -> x2,y2
> where x1,y1 are the coordinates of one end the line segment and x2,y2 are the
> coordinates of the other end. These line segments include the points at both
> ends. In other words:
>
> - An entry like 1,1 -> 1,3 covers points 1,1, 1,2, and 1,3.
> - An entry like 9,7 -> 7,7 covers points 9,7, 8,7, and 7,7.
>
> For now, only consider horizontal and vertical lines: lines where either x1 =
> x2 or y1 = y2.
>
> [...]
>
> To avoid the most dangerous areas, you need to determine the number of points
> where at least two lines overlap. [...]
>
> Consider only horizontal and vertical lines. At how many points do at least
> two lines overlap?

### Part 2

> Unfortunately, considering only horizontal and vertical lines doesn't give
> you the full picture; you need to also consider diagonal lines.
>
> Because of the limits of the hydrothermal vent mapping system, the lines in
> your list will only ever be horizontal, vertical, or a diagonal line at
> exactly 45 degrees. In other words:
>
> - An entry like 1,1 -> 3,3 covers points 1,1, 2,2, and 3,3.
> - An entry like 9,7 -> 7,9 covers points 9,7, 8,8, and 7,9.
>
> [...]
>
> Consider all of the lines. At how many points do at least two lines overlap?

## Full solution

```d
auto input = stdin.byLineCopy()
    .map!`a.splitter(" -> ").map!"a.splitter(',').map!(to!long).array".array`.array;
auto xy =input.map!(l => [max(l[0][0], l[1][0]), max(l[0][1],l[1][1])])
    .array.transposed.map!maxElement.array;
size_t[][] a = new size_t[(xy[0]+1)*(xy[1]+1)].evenChunks(xy[1]+1).array;
foreach(p; input) {
    if(p[0][0] == p[1][0])
        if(p[0][1] > p[1][1]) foreach(e; p[1][1]..p[0][1]+1) ++a[e][p[0][0]];
        else foreach(e; p[0][1]..p[1][1]+1) ++a[e][p[0][0]];
    else if(p[0][1] == p[1][1])
        if(p[1][0] > p[0][0]) foreach(e; p[0][0]..p[1][0]+1) ++a[p[0][1]][e];
        else foreach(e; p[1][0]..p[0][0]+1) ++a[p[0][1]][e];
    else if(1) // change this value to 0 for first part
    {
        auto x1 = p[0][0], x2 = p[1][0], y1 = p[0][1], y2 = p[1][1];
        if(x1 > x2) { swap(x1,x2); swap(y1, y2); }
        foreach(e; x1..x2+1)
            if(y2>y1) ++a[y1+(e-x1)][e];
            else ++a[y1-(e-x1)][e];
    }
}
// construct the map
//a.map!(l => l.map!`a.to!string == "0" ? "." : a.to!string`.join).each!writeln;
a.join.filter!"a > 1".count.writeln;
```
