Hi D community!

I'm here again, to describe what I've done during the fourth week of Symmetry
Autumn of Code.

## Finishing the patch split

I'm happy to announce the full list of patches since the split:

- https://reviews.llvm.org/D111414
- https://reviews.llvm.org/D111415
- https://reviews.llvm.org/D111416
- https://reviews.llvm.org/D111417
- https://reviews.llvm.org/D111419
- https://reviews.llvm.org/D111420
- https://reviews.llvm.org/D111421
- https://reviews.llvm.org/D111422
- https://reviews.llvm.org/D111423
- https://reviews.llvm.org/D111424
- https://reviews.llvm.org/D111425
- https://reviews.llvm.org/D111426
- https://reviews.llvm.org/D111428
- https://reviews.llvm.org/D111429
- https://reviews.llvm.org/D111430
- https://reviews.llvm.org/D111431
- https://reviews.llvm.org/D111432

This includes some little changes and it already have a ton of discussion! Some
things are little disappointing and other somewhat rigid, in my point of view,
since some patches are "too atomic" according to the reviewers. Some other
stuff, however I totally understand, since it increases the overall LLVM code
quality, even though being nit picking. I'm going to try to circumvent the
issues and strive to push this forward as much as I can.

## Reflected GCC Patches

By reading the code twice, during the split, I found out some other stuff
considered interesting to change on the GCC side, so I made some patches:

- Usage of distinguishable tuple(), instead of wrong templated Tuple!():
  https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/gcc-patches/2021-October/581577.html
- Write distinguishable variadics and add missing tests to the test suite:
  https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/gcc-patches/2021-October/581574.html
- Add test cases for missing coverage tests:
  https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/gcc-patches/2021-October/581588.html and
  https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/gcc-patches/2021-October/581590.html

I also generically answered previously submitted patches and resubmit some
malformed/wrong patches I made, with some help by Iain.

## Announcement on the `llvm-dev` mailing list

I announced the D demangler change into llvm-dev mailing list, as requested by
LLVM reviewers. If you want to interact and discuss there, feel free to do it
so: https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2021-October/153267.html

## Minor updates on GCC bugzilla

I added this missing bugzilla report:
- https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=102702

Since Eric Gallager added me to CC list for various fuzzing issues to GCC
demangler, I decided to create an issue about the time complexity problem,
https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=102732 , similar to what was
reported by c++ demangler (https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=80002).

## What's next?

Next week I'm going to keep an eye on the patches and fix the suggested
changes, as usual. About the next milestone, I already have some drafts about
things to look at and differences between compilers DWARF generation. I also
have an hint of how to implement it, so probably I'm going to work on some
draft implementation. Because the demangler is already ported/implemented, just
reviewing is necessary, I think I can move forward with a draft implementation
of the next milestone, although this is something I need to discuss with my
mentor. On the meanwhile, I made my TODO list open and automatically deployed,
at least daily, so you can see what I'm doing during the week
[here](tasks.lsferreira.net) .
