## The challenge

> You're already almost 1.5km (almost a mile) below the surface of the ocean,
> already so deep that you can't see any sunlight. What you can see, however,
> is a giant squid that has attached itself to the outside of your submarine.
>
> Maybe it wants to play bingo?
>
> Bingo is played on a set of boards each consisting of a 5x5 grid of numbers.
> Numbers are chosen at random, and the chosen number is marked on all boards
> on which it appears. (Numbers may not appear on all boards.) If all numbers
> in any row or any column of a board are marked, that board wins. (Diagonals
> don't count.)
>
> [...]
>
> To guarantee victory against the giant squid, figure out which board will win
> first. What will your final score be if you choose that board?

## Part 1

### Full solution

```d
auto input = [stdin.byLineCopy().array].map!(a => [                         // input
    a.front.splitter(",").map!(to!long).array,                              // parse numbers
    a[1..$].map!`a.splitter(" ").filter!"!a.empty".map!(to!long)`           // parse cards
    .joiner.array]).front;
immutable ncards = input[1].length / 25;                                    // calc number of cards
foreach(pos, i; input[0]) foreach(c; 0..ncards) {                           // for each number & card
    foreach(n; 0..25) if(input[1][c*25 + n] == i) input[1][c*25 + n] = -1;  // set matching numbers
    auto e = evenChunks(input[1][c*25..c*25+25],5).array;                   // construct card RoR
    foreach(el; zip(e, e.dup.transposed)) if(findSkip(el[0], repeat(-1L,5)) // find row
            || findSkip(el[1], repeat(-1L,5))) {                            // find column
        writeln(input[1][c*25..c*25+25].filter!"a != -1".sum * i);          // calculate result
        return;                                                             // hang
    }
}
```

## Part 2

> On the other hand, it might be wise to try a different strategy: let the
> giant squid win.
>
> You aren't sure how many bingo boards a giant squid could play at once, so
> rather than waste time counting its arms, the safe thing to do is to figure
> out which board will win last and choose that one. That way, no matter which
> boards it picks, it will win for sure.
>
> [...]
>
> Figure out which board will win last. Once it wins, what would its final
> score be?

            writeln(input[1][c*25..c*25+25].filter!"a != -1".sum * i);      // calculate result
