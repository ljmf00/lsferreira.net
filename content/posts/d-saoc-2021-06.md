Hi D community!

I'm here again, to describe what I've done during the sixth week of Symmetry
Autumn of Code.

## LLVM Patches follow up

The first two patches were merged into the LLVM tree!

- https://reviews.llvm.org/D111947
- https://reviews.llvm.org/D111948

Hopefully we can now proceed with merging the demangling patches as the next
step.

## LLDB D Plugin

This week I primarily worked on getting the D plugin working. I added two
features to the plugin which includes handling D slices generically and the
special case of string slices. They are now formatted as a D string literal,
depending on its encoding.

This is a reduced example of what the LLDB can show to the user, with the D
plugin.

```
* thread #1, name = 'app', stop reason = signal SIGSEGV: invalid address (fault address: 0xdeadbeef)
    frame #0: 0x0000555555555edc app`app.foobar(p=0x00000000deadbeef, a=([0] = 1, [1] = 2, [2] = 3), ...) at app.d:43:2
   40           immutable(dchar)[] sh = "double atum"d.dup;
   41           const(wchar)[] si = "wide atum"w.dup;
   42
-> 43           return *p;
   44   }
   45
   46   class CFoo {
(lldb) fr v
(int *) p = 0x00000000deadbeef
(int[]) a = ([0] = 1, [1] = 2, [2] = 3)
(long double) c = 123.122999999999999998
(Foo) f = {}
(string) sa = "atum"
(wstring) sb = "wide atum"w
(dstring) sc = "double atum"d
(char[]) sd = "atum"
(dchar[]) se = "double atum"d
(wchar[]) sf = "wide atum"w
(const(char)[]) sg = "atum"
(dstring) sh = "double atum"d
(const(wchar)[]) si = "wide atum"w
```

If you are excited to test it by yourself, checkout
[this](https://github.com/ljmf00/llvm-project/commits/llvm-plugin-d) branch and
compile lldb. I suggest the following steps:

```bash
# To use clang to compiler LLVM
export CC=clang
export CXX=clang++

# CMake flags (compile to different target if you are not using x86)
cmake -S llvm -B build -G Ninja \
	-DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang;lldb" \
	-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
	-DLLDB_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS=OFF \
	-DLLVM_OPTIMIZED_TABLEGEN=ON \
	-DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON \
	-DLLDB_ENABLE_PYTHON=ON \
	-DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="X86" \
	-DLLVM_CCACHE_BUILD=ON \
	-DLLVM_LINK_LLVM_DYLIB=ON \
	-DCLANG_LINK_CLANG_DYLIB=ON

ninja -C build lldb lldb-server
ldc2 -g app.d
./build/bin/lldb app
```

You can also use
[this](https://gist.github.com/ljmf00/a35da0e41c3a2074d74960e981f43ca6) file,
which is what I use to test the D plugin and used to show the above example.

### Issues

During the plugin development and testing, I found out that LLDB was not
properly showing UTF8 strings when using `char8_t` types with different names
so I made a patch to fix it: https://reviews.llvm.org/D112564 . An issue was
also created to cross reference the fix
https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=52324 . This is particularly an issue for
the D formatter if the compiler exports types with different type names, which
they should.  Debuggers should be able to read encoding DWARF tags and rely on
that first, instead of hardcoding the formatters. LLDB does that but this
somehow got skipped on https://reviews.llvm.org/D66447 .

While reading how plugin are built with their internal C++ interface, I found
very repetitive code and decide to patch it: https://reviews.llvm.org/D112658 .

I also happened to reproduce
[this](https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45856) issue that Mathias reported
a while ago and decided to investigate on it since it indirectly affects the
behaviour on D side. I got some conclusions and I believe this is a regression
introduced in 2015. Please read the issue for more context.

I found other issues on the LDC side and DMD side that I already added to my
task list, including:
- DMD should use wchar and dchar type names instead of `wchar_t`: This triggers
  the hardcoded formatters to format char pointers wrongly. Furthermore this is
  wrongly typed since `wchar_t` is not exactly UTF16, according to the C
  standard.
- DMD also reports other types as C style naming instead of D style
- LDC reports hardcoded const(char) type instead of a DWARF type modifier

### Mailing list announcement

As discussed erlier in a LLDB bug, I decided to write to the `llvm-dev` and
`lldb-dev` mailing list to discuss about upstreaming the D language plugin. You
can follow up the thread
[here](https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/lldb-dev/2021-October/017101.html).

## What is next?

Next week, I'm going to try to fix the above listed issues on either DMD and
LDC trees. I need to be careful with these changes to make sure I don't break
GDB behaviour, if they are relying on the hardcoded types. If that is the case
I'll try to patch it too. I'm going to also finish my DWARF refactor on the
backend to handle DWARF abbreviations correctly. The objective of the second
milestone is finished but I'm going to try to study more features to improve
pretty printing.
