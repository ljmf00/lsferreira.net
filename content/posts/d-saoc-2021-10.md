Hi D community!

I'm here again, to describe what I've done during the tenth week of Symmetry
Autumn of Code.

## LLVM upstream follow up update

During the discussion for the next patch in the train, 4 more patches have been
raised, due to request to split it even more:

- https://reviews.llvm.org/D114305
- https://reviews.llvm.org/D114307
- https://reviews.llvm.org/D114308
- https://reviews.llvm.org/D114309

Some more changes were made on other existing patches due to further discussion
on implementation details.

I also proposed a minor change on the specification to accommodate artificial
local parent symbols when mangling ambiguities happen, see
[here](https://github.com/dlang/dlang.org/pull/3124).

## Minimal TypeSystem for D

This week I finally focused on getting a minimal TypeSystem working for D on
the LLDB. This means nothing to the end user and huge change need to be made to
make it functional exactly the same as is right now, the main difference is
that, instead of relying on Clang type system, we have our own.

For now it has the Clang type system disabled and detects D as usual, but does
nothing, when requesting any type information.

The current changes for the implementation of D TypeSystem will be in
[this](https://github.com/ljmf00/lldb-d/pull/1) PR.

I decided to create a seperate repository for this until I have a decent plugin
to upstream. As this might take a while to implement, I would like to ask the
community if it is worth to do some builds to several platforms with the
demangling and language formatters enabled? I'm particularly asking this since
building LLVM is a beefy task and some may not be able to do it easily with
their machine. What is your thoughts?

## What is next?

I will continue implementing TypeSystem for D as well as a new type wrapper to
represent a D type. I'm going to start adding support for very basic types.

You can also read this on the D programming language forum,
[here](https://forum.dlang.org/thread/mailman.1018.1637883198.11670.digitalmars-d@puremagic.com),
and discuss there, including your thoughts about the asked questions!
