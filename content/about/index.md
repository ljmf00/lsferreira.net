## Lu√≠s Ferreira

{{< right-avatar src="avatar.jpg" alt="My profile picture" >}}

Hey there, I'm a 20 years old student passioned for computers, highly motivated and interested for Free Software movement and Open Source projects. I like to develop correct and secure back-end infrastructures with the low-level power. I'm mostly proficient in D, C and C++.

I'm interested in developing compilers and parsers. I also like to tinker with highly distributed systems and develop tooling and integrate them. I'm the founder of [aurorafoss.org](https://aurorafoss.org/).
